Chana Masala
Serving size: 4

INGREDIENTS
3 Tbsp. vegetable oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 tsp. coriander seeds
1 tsp. cumin seeds
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 2" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped
1 tsp. garam masala
¼ tsp. ground turmeric
 Pinch of cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper flakes
1 medium tomato, peeled, chopped
2 14.5-oz. cans chickpeas, rinsed
1 Tbsp. double-concentrated tomato paste
 Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
1 tsp. cornstarch
2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
 Chopped cilantro and rice and/or flatbread (for serving)

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
A spice mill or mortar and pestle

DIRECTIONS
Step 1: Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan or small pot over medium-low. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and very tender, 15–20 minutes.
Step 2: Meanwhile, toast coriander seeds and cumin seeds in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until slightly darkened and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool; finely grind.
Step 3: Add spice mixture, garlic, ginger, garam masala, turmeric, and cayenne to pan with onion. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add tomato, chickpeas, tomato paste, and 2 cups very hot water; season with salt and pepper. Cover pan; simmer, adding up to 1 cup more hot water if chana masala looks dry, until chickpeas are very tender and sauce is flavorful, 45–60 minutes.
Step 4: Stir cornstarch and 2 tsp. water in a small bowl, then stir into chana masala. Simmer just until thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in olive oil. Season with more salt if needed.
Step 5: Top chana masala with cilantro and serve with rice and/or flatbread.
