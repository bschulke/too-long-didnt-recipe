DIRECTIONS
MANGO JELLY: Blend lime zest, lime juice, mango nectar, half of mangoes, and a small pinch of salt in a blender until very smooth.
Step 1: Heat gelatin and ½ cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until gelatin is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in mango purée. Pour jelly into a 9x5" loaf pan. Carefully add remaining mangoes and stir to combine. Cover jelly tightly and chill until set, 20–30 minutes.
Step 2: Do ahead: Mango jelly can be made 5 days ahead. Keep chilled.
