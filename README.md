# too-long-didnt-recipe
For everyone who hates the long stories people add to their recipe articles.

## Action items // to do:
* test on multiple BonAppetit recipes
* pretty format for output
  * save to text file, open text file
* scrape units from ofThing and make new column


### Stretch goals:
* user input?
* ADD A RECIPE SCALING OPTION (like "double this recipe" or "halve this recipe")


### SUPER Stretch goals:
* make this a basic HTML website, where you input the URL of the recipe and it will output the ingredients and steps on the website.
  * consider caching recipes that have been run?
  * give option to save recipe to file
* what if we made this into a mobile app that can be used as a plugin on a web browser?
* test on other non-BonAppetit recipe websites!

### Thoughts:
For this script version, we need to think about how it will work out of the box for any user.
