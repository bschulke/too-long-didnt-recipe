# too-long-didnt-recipe
For everyone who hates the long stories people add to their recipe articles.

## Action items // to do:
* test on multiple BonAppetit recipes
  * make a more intelligent xpath loc for title
  * figure out new serving size location
  * debug steps for loop breaking
  * add an exception for SPECIAL EQUIPMENT inside the ingredients list
* pretty format for output


### Stretch goals:
* user input?
* ADD A RECIPE SCALING OPTION (like "double this recipe" or "halve this recipe")


### SUPER Stretch goals:
* make this a basic HTML website, where you input the URL of the recipe and it will output the ingredients and steps on the website.
  * consider caching recipes that have been run?
  * give option to save recipe to file
* what if we made this into a mobile app that can be used as a plugin on a web browser?
* test on other non-BonAppetit recipe websites!
