# too-long-didnt-recipe
For everyone who hates the long stories people add to their recipe articles.

## Action items // to do:
* scrape recipe directions/steps
  * figure out how to store this (currently planned: 1 column pandas df for steps)
* get title
* store serving size somehow
  * make a dictionary `recipe` to house all of these values!
* test on multiple BonAppetit recipes


### Stretch goals:
* user input?
* pretty format for output!
* ADD A RECIPE SCALING OPTION (like "double this recipe" or "halve this recipe")


### SUPER Stretch goals:
* make this a basic HTML website, where you input the URL of the recipe and it will output the ingredients and steps on the website.
  * consider caching recipes that have been run?
  * give option to save recipe to file
* what if we made this into a mobile app that can be used as a plugin on a web browser?
* test on other non-BonAppetit recipe websites!
