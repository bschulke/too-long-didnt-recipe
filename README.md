# too-long-didnt-recipe
For everyone who hates the long stories people add to their recipe articles.

By [@bschulke](https://github.com/bschulke) and [@aibhleog](https://github.com/aibhleog)

## Previously on our show, we:
* remembered what exactly we did a while ago :facepalm:
* double-checked the helpful tags we discovered previously
* talked through inital steps to search for subheaders and then print the sections
* added notes in get_ingredients.py and made commented sections

## Action items // to do:
* deal with empty spaces in ingredients list and instructions without numbers (like "Do Ahead")
* add a try/except for ingredients or instruction steps where there are subsections
* can we search for an element by part of a class name?


### Stretch goals:
* saving file info -- first time run prompt user to specify location/path if not inside repo?
* user input?
* ADD A RECIPE SCALING OPTION (like "double this recipe" or "halve this recipe")

### SUPER Stretch goals:
* make this a basic HTML website, where you input the URL of the recipe and it will output the ingredients and steps on the website.
  * consider caching recipes that have been run?
  * give option to save recipe to file
* what if we made this into a mobile app that can be used as a plugin on a web browser?
* test on other non-BonAppetit recipe websites!

### Thoughts:
For this script version, we need to think about how it will work out of the box for any user.
